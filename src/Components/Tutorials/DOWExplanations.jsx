        <p id="Soc" className="dow-each-description">Many a psychologist would say that we are inherently social creatures.  They would say that even the most secluded person tends to need some socialization in some form.  In our modern day and age, socializing is a huge part of our culture, with rising technology.  Socializing itself hasn’t become more important but the way our generations and the generations of our residents do it was just different.  It was no less important in the past as it is now.  The reason I put social first is because most activities have an aspect of socialization.  There are some people who come to an activity not for the activity itself but for the chance to socialize or be with other people.  Social wellness is built in to most other things we do.</p>

        <p id="phy" className="dow-each-description">This dimension of wellness goes beyond nursing.  Nursing has a huge impact on physical wellness but not all of it.  Think about people in their youth - some people are not fulfilled without playing sports or going to the gym on a regular basis or are hyper-focused on the impact of the food they eat.  Our activity calendar should fulfill this dimension not only with the obvious exercise but with sports-related activities as well.  Sports have not only the physical aspect but the social aspect of being with people or working together.  </p>

        <p id="emo"className="dow-each-description">We all have days where we just feel blah.  We may know why but we also may not.  While we’re primarily trying to bring out the emotion of happiness, contentment, or fulfillment in our residents, it may not always be possible.  Our activities should be engaging enough that they can be a temporary mood enhancer for someone.  But the primary way to enhance emotional wellness in a person is through one on one interaction.  We are NOT psychologists and do not know the rhyme, reason, or “cure” for why someone feels the way they do but that doesn’t mean we cannot help.  We can be a listening ear.  We can fix minor problems that may be causing emotional distress (ex-”so and so said she didn’t like me!” “Oh, no!  That’s not true!  I was there, you misheard her”.....etc).  We can also offer independent activity that may help such as suggesting journaling, talking to someone they trust, providing distraction through independent activity, or by advocating for our resident to a different department if need be.</p>

    return (
        <p id="spi"className="dow-each-description">Spiritual importance has a varying degree of influence over everyone.  For some people, this aspect of wellness comes close to the import of their own health and for others, it’s a “meh”.  For some people, this also changes as they age.  I’ve heard everything from “I already spent years going to church” to “I give thanks to my lord every day” to “I don’t believe in anything, really.”  We have to be open and able to push our own beliefs and thoughts on spiritual matters aside in order to cater to our resident population.  At the average age of our residents, they are usually long past looking for alternative beliefs or wanting to learn about other belief systems (although there are always exceptions). </p>

    return (
        <p id="env"className="dow-each-description">In the wake of Covid, the importance of environmental wellness has become even more clear than ever before.  Environmental wellness encompasses our residents’ rooms, their decor, their clothes, their courtyard, and their facility as a whole.  We have some degree of influence over the facility as a whole in terms of decorating, sprucing up spaces, and making it feel welcome.  But people’s rooms and how it’s set up are just as important.  Nursing staff usually doesn’t have time to “put this here” or “hang this up”.  We’re the ones that should say yes to those requests.  Use some of your one on one time with a person to make their own spaces great to enhance their environmental wellness.  </p>

        <p id="fin"className="dow-each-description">Financial wellness is a dimension we do not have any influence over for our residents but it is one to be aware of because it can cause anxieties that could still affect our residents.  While we cannot do anything about their financial wellness, there may be a time where it will cause us to be a listening ear or a person to vent to.  </p>

    return (
        <p id="int" className="dow-each-description">Intellectual wellness, in some ways, is not for everyone.  Not everyone feels fulfilled when they learn something new or finish a difficult puzzle, but for some people, it is the epitome of success and releases the same endorphins for them that are released for athletes in practice and competition.  For those people, their intellectual wellness needs to be tangibly fulfilled, they need something to work on, something to challenge them, or something to learn.  For others, their intellectual wellness is attained by robust conversation or keeping up with the news and current events.  Even for those who think they don’t need intellectual wellness, everyone feels good when they get an answer correct in a game or outsmart an opponent.  There are a variety of means to fulfill this need for different people.</p>

        <p id="cre"className="dow-each-description">I like relating the dimensions of wellness to my own life to keep me grounded in the fact that these are things that we all, as human beings, need in our life for fulfillment.  Personally, when I go a couple weeks without creating something, I get downright moody.  I get depressed.  Creativity is expressed in so many different fashions whether it be traditional arts, dance and music, construction and building, cooking and baking, or cultivating a small spot of earth.  There are so many different ways to allow a person to be creative rather than just crafts or coloring.  Letting people express their creativity in a variety of ways will lend into overall happiness.  </p>

        <p id="occ"className="dow-each-description">Many of us take pride in the work we do.  Many of our residents spent long years working or raising children.  Some people look forward to the break of retirement.  That it is an end to all the work.  Others are left searching for meaning.  Others still seek to be useful like they were in their working years.  While unable to do jobs they did previously, that doesn’t mean you can’t ask little “favors” or give to simple jobs to people in order to allow them this sense of fulfillment.  Whether it be asking them to decorate a bulletin board or asking them if they can share some knowledge they have with someone else, there are a variety of ways to allow for people to feel useful in these years as well.  </p>

        <p id="sen"className="dow-each-description">Usually in this profession, sensory activities are thought to be for people with diminished mental capacities.  However, using myself as an example, I absolutely refuse to eat things of certain textures, regardless of taste.  This is based on my own sensory preferences.  I can think of very few people who run their hand over a brand new soft blanket and don’t respond with pleasure or happiness.  Our sensory input is very important.  Smells can spark memories, music can cause emotion, soft things can bring comfort, certain colors can elicit certain responses, and some tastes in and of themselves can cause pure bliss for people. </p>
