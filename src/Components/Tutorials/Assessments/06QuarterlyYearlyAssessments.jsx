            <h1>Assessment Updates</h1>
            <p>In my state, it's required to assess all care areas every three months and that includes activities!  This is a chance to put each resident front and center in your mind and evaluate their needs and modify their care plan accordingly.  When you have a lot of residents, your assessments stack up week after week and sometimes you end up going through the motions.  You have to think, though, that this is the one time in three months that this person may have your full and undivided attention.  Do not under value your quarterly assessment, even if there appear to be no changes in this area.  Make sure.  Double check that independent activity supplies are stocked and in their proper place.  Make sure their CD player, TV remote, or whatever is functioning properly.  Make sure their room is up to their standards and that it's accessible.  Talk to them, if they're able, and make sure they're content with what it is that you're offering.  </p>

            <p>Doing these assessments are often simpler than admission assessments.  By all but the first quarterly assessment, you usually know your residents much better and are able to put more accurate information into their care plan.  You should be thorough and ensure that your information is accurate.  Your yearly assessments are the same thing, but usually require that you write a more complete summary (a CAA - care area assessment) if you have a hand in the MDS documentation.  You would also have to write an assessment any time there is a change in condition or a trigger in their section F, D, or C interviews.  MDS is something more specific that will be covered in future tutorials.</p>

            <p>The most difficult and drastic changes to care plans are end of life care plans and significant change care plans.  </p>

            <p>When a resident has a certain amount of changes, for better or worse, inclusive of many different areas of care, a significant change is triggered.  To note, activities themselves cannot directly trigger these significant changes, which is part of why often times, nursing staff don't even include activities in these discussions.  However, the psychosocial wellbeing of a resident can.  This are is sometimes handled by a social services director, behavioral specialist, or nursing staff.  Occasionally, it's up to activities as well, if the credentials are right.  </p>

            <p>As far as care planning goes, a significant change can mean very little for activities or it could mean a complete overhaul of your care plan, as your resident's capabilities have changed.  This is a time when you need to carefully assess your interventions.</p>

            <p>End of life is always difficult to talk about and experience, but it's something that also needs to have drastic changes in the care plan.  Most things don't apply anymore during end of life care.  Your resident is not going to be up and about during end of life. </p> 

            <p>Your end of life care plan should focus on one to one activities and calming and relaxing passive things (based on preference this could be background music, favorite movies, or audiobooks).  You should also focus on family visitors and volunteers coming to be with your resident in what could be their last moments.  To be honest, there is little you can do during many end-of life care situations.  Ensuring the person is not alone is one of the most important things. </p>
