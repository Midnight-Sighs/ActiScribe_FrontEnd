            <h1>Interpretting Your Assessments</h1>
            <p>So you've done your assessment and gathered your information.  How do you translate this into a care plan?  You aren't going to put each item from your assessment into a separate intervention.  As you can see, I like to explain things in detail and ramble a bit.  Every mentor I've had in care planning and writing for my assessments has stressed the importance of short and sweet.  This is for a few different reasons.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>You care staff is in a hurry.  They aren't going to take the time to read more than a few bullet points because, quite frankly, they don't usually have the time.  </li>
                <li>People tend to skim information.  If you have long winded sentences and explanations, unless a person WANTS to know the information, they aren't going to take the time to read it.  (To note, with all this, I do NOT take that advice.  There is a time and a place for efficiency and I feel like if someone truly wants to learn something, then more detail is best.)</li>
                <li>State surveyors.  If you have a care plan with a ton of detail and goals for your resident, when the state survey comes through, they are going to hold you accountable for each and every intervention.  It is much better to write "invite Jane to Bible study" than "Jane comes to Bible Study every Sunday."  What happens if the minister is out for three weeks and surveyors come and during their interview with Jane, they discover she hasn't been at bible study for three weeks?  It's in her care plan that she goes every Sunday, why wasn't it adhered to? </li>
            </ol>
            <p>As a side note, I have seen very few tags on survey for activities, even in facilities I've been in where they got put into 'Stop Placement'.  Mostly the tags I HAVE seen came from lack of documentation and assessments, not for the wording of the care plan.  But you donâ€™t want to leave that open to chance.  You may get a surveyor who is going through a cut in pay and just came of a stint doing 12s to make up for it and is in a foul mood and decides you're the easy target.  Who knows?  Cover your butt.  More so for their sake, you want to make sure the information in your care plan is up to date so you're proving you know your residents and are meeting their current needs.  You don't want your care plan to say "assist with Jane's phone as needed" when her phone broke six months ago.  That's going to show you aren't updating your care plans or paying attention to your resident.  Sure some things can slip through the cracks and we don't notice and many surveyors know we're only human so if it only happens in one care plan, you're probably fine.  But that may cause them to look into others and if it's a pattern, that could spell fines for your facility and include possible ramifications for you.</p>

            <p>Back to the matter at hand.  How do you translate this information on your assessment into a care plan? Let's say you gathered the following information on the previous assessment.  Next, we're going to look at an example, and Jane is answering all of her own questions and based on her nursing assessments and history provided by her and her family, is mentally capable of providing all her own answers. </p>
