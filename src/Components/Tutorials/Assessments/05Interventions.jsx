            <h1>What Are Interventions?</h1>
            <p>Interventions can include so many different things.  However, while the task of assigning an intervention to something can feel alien, it's something we do every day with our loved ones.  I'll give you two examples from my own life.  </p>

            <p>My boyfriend gets depressed when the mechanical project he's working on isn't going well.  His mood goes down, he obsessively looks for solutions and parts online for hours and days at a time.  An intervention for him that I use is stopping whatever I'm doing and force him to talk about the problem.  This doesn't work for everyone, but for him it helps him to work through the problem in a different way when he goes through it aloud.  It sounds like a simple solution because it is.  Sometimes simplicity is all we need.  However, in our "go, go, go world", sometimes slowing down to do so is actually difficult and something we need a reminder to do.  So a care plan for this would look like this:</p>

            <span className = "extra-tab">"Focus: at risk for activity impairment d/t obsessive focuses on failing projects"</span>
            <br /><span className = "extra-tab">"Goal: to increase mood during periods of difficulty"</span>
            <br /><span className = "extra-tab">"Intervention: Offer [resident] to verbalize their issue and help them to problem solve aloud."</span>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>Another good example is my grandpa.  Now granted this example pertains to the home but the train of thought and working through the logic is the same.  </p>

            <p>Background: My grandpa loves to cook and has always cooked for the family.  It would be one of his primary activities.  However, his memory is failing and he's creating/being in dangerous situations in the kitchen.  An intervention in his care plan could look something like this:</p>

            <span className = "extra-tab">Focus: At risk for activity impairment d/t deteriorating memory and motor skills</span>
            <br /><span className = "extra-tab">Goal: To allow [resident] to continue pursuing his activity interests in a safe way.</span>
            <br /><span className = "extra-tab">Interventions:</span>
            
            <br /><span className = "extra-tab-two">- Monitor during activity for safety.  Provide verbal cues/reminders.</span>
            <br /><span className = "extra-tab-two">- Assign cooking tasks of a suitable capability.  Ask [resident] to do the mixing or measuring while you do chopping and handle heat sources</span>
            <br /><span className = "extra-tab-two">- Assure the cooking space is safe, clean, and organized at the beginning and end of use.</span>
            <br />
            <p>I provided examples that are more closely related to an every day life so that you can see that we use interventions all the time.  If you have children, your day is full of interventions and redirection.  For our residents, their facility IS every day life. </p> 

            <p>Interventions should include preferences, adaptations, redirections, and instructions for staff to assist in creating fulfillment in the lives of our residents.  </p>
