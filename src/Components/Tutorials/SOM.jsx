                    <h1>What is the SOM?</h1>
                    <p>The SOM stands for the State Operations Manual.  The SOM provides guidelines for all areas of nursing.  There are many related to activities and while the SOM is a dry read, it's necessary to have this resource.  Below, the bits of the SOM that are related to activities will be listed and are current as of 2021.  Although they're current as of this writing, these are for reference and should be something you actively look up and keep up to date on.  Your facility may also let you know when there are updates to the SOM as it applies to all areas of care.  </p>

                    <h5>§483.10(f)(1) </h5>
                    <p>The resident has a right to choose activities, schedules (including sleeping and waking times), health care and providers of health care services consistent with his or her interests, assessments, and plan of care and other applicable provisions of this part. </p>

                    <p>The resident has a right to make choices about aspects of his or her life in the facility that are significant to the resident. </p>

                <div>
                    <h5>§483.10(f)(3) </h5>
                    <p>The resident has a right to interact with members of the community and participate in community activities both inside and outside the facility. </p>
                </div>

                    <h5>§483.10(f)(8) </h5>
                    <p>The resident has a right to participate in other activities, including social, religious, and community activities that do not interfere with the rights of other residents in the facility</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h5>§483.10(f)(1)-(3), (8) </h5>
                    <p>The intent of this requirement is to ensure that each resident has the opportunity to exercise his or her autonomy regarding those things that are important in his or her life. This includes the residents’ interests and preferences. </p>
                    <p>GUIDANCE: It is important for residents to have a choice about which activities they participate in, whether they are part of the formal activities program or self-directed. Additionally, a resident’s needs and choices for how he or she spends time, both inside and outside the facility, should also be supported and accommodated, to the extent possible, including making transportation arrangements. Residents have the right to choose their schedules, consistent with their interests, assessments, and care plans. This includes, but is not limited to, choices about the schedules that are important to the resident, such as waking, eating, bathing, and going to bed at night. Choices about schedules and ensuring that residents are able to get enough sleep is an important contributor to overall health and well-being. Residents also have the right to choose health care schedules consistent with their interests and preferences, and information should be gathered to proactively assist residents with the fulfillment of their choices. Facilities must not develop a schedule for care, such as waking or bathing schedules, for staff convenience and without the input of the residents.</p>
                        <p>Examples that demonstrate the support and accommodation of resident goals, preferences, and choices include, but are not limited to: 
                            <br />
                            • If a resident shares that attendance at family gatherings or external community events is of interest to them, the resident’s goals of attending these events should be accommodated, to the extent possible. 
                            <br />
                            • If a resident mentions that his or her therapy is scheduled at the time of a favorite television program, the resident’s preference should be accommodated, to the extent possible. 
                            <br />
                            • If a resident refuses a bath because he or she prefers a shower or a different bathing method, such as in-bed bathing, prefers to bathe at a different time of day or on a different day, does not feel well that day, is uneasy about the aide assigned to help or is worried about falling, the resident’s preferences must be accommodated.</p>
