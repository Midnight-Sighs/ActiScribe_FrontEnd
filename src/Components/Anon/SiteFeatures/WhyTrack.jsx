                <h1>Why Track Participation?</h1>
                <p>I've had some facilities require it.  Others tell me not to because the state doesn't require it.  But on the flip side of that, when it comes to nursing - "if it isn't written down, it didn't happen".  If you don't document participation, how accurately can you truly remember a person's participation, habits, and patterns and see the changes when it comes time to write your assessments?  Assessments ARE required in activities.  Some facilities have a social services director or a behavioral specialist write these, but at the end of the day, YOU know your resident activity habits best.  If that's the case in your facility, I encourage you to talk to your administration and evaluate your IDT.  You need to be a part of that team or at the very least, you need to work closely with whomever else may be writing those activity assessments.  That's your ball park.  </p>
