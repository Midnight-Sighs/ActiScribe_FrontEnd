                <p> Why do we sort activities by these things called dimensions of wellness and what are they?</p>
                <p>The State Operations Manual isn't clear about activity guidelines and from facility to facility, you'll find that standards can vary to the extreme.  The dimensions of wellness are something that impact ALL our lives, not just the lives of our residents.  They're the psychosocial and physiological needs that we, as human beings, need to have wellness in our lives.  These are the categories in which we all need to strive to find balance in and our residents are no exception.  By dividing activities up into categories in this manner, we can see what areas of wellness our residents may be lacking it.  That's not to say that our organized activities are the only way our residents attain this wellness, but it's a good measuring point to assist in making a well rounded activity plan for our residents and to individualize when it comes to care planning and problem solving for individual people. </p>
                <h1>Why Track Participation?</h1>
                <p>I've had some facilities require it.  Others tell me not to because the state doesn't require it.  But on the flip side of that, when it comes to nursing - "if it isn't written down, it didn't happen".  If you don't document participation, how accurately can you truly remember a person's participation, habits, and patterns and see the changes when it comes time to write your assessments?  Assessments ARE required in activities.  Some facilities have a social services director or a behavioral specialist write these, but at the end of the day, YOU know your resident activity habits best.  If that's the case in your facility, I encourage you to talk to your administration and evaluate your IDT.  You need to be a part of that team or at the very least, you need to work closely with whomever else may be writing those activity assessments.  That's your ball park.  </p>
